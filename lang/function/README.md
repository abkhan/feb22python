# Functions

Is a way to divide software into useful blocks.

## Exercise

In this exercise you'll use an existing function, and while adding your own to create a fully functional program.

Add a function named list_benefits() that returns the following list of strings: "More organized code", "More readable code", "Easier code reuse", "Allowing programmers to share and connect code together"

Add a function named build_sentence(info) which receives a single argument containing a string and returns a sentence starting with the given string and ending with the string " is a benefit of functions!"

Run and see all the functions work together!
